This project allows you to upload an image via a Discord bot which then sends API requests to Yahoo finance to gather data. From here, the data is sent to OpenAI API to analyze. User data is also saved via Django backend to create ease of use.

To run, make sure you have the following packages:
requests -> pip install requests
BeautifulSoup -> pip install beautifulsoup4
openpyxl -> pip install openpyxl
